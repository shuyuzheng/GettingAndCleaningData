# An Project for Coursera online course "Getting and Cleaning Data"

This repository contains my solution for the final project task required by Coursera online course "Getting and Cleaning Data". Details about the project can be found [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning/peer/FIZtT/getting-and-cleaning-data-course-project).

# Content in this repository

1. `/UCI HAR Dataset`: a directory contains the raw data for the project which is down loaded from [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).
2. `run_analysis.R`: the R script I used to clean the original dataset and generate the `tidy_data.txt` file.
3. `tidy_data.txt`: the tidy data set generated from `/UCI HAR Dataset` according to the requirement of the project. The details about this dataset and the processing can be found in `CodeBook.md`.
3. `CodeBook.md`: a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that were performed to clean up the data.
4. `CodeBook.Rmd`: a rmarkdown file used to generate `CodeBook.md` file.
